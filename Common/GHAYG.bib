abstract = {Comprehensive and authoritative assessment of the prospects for agriculture and food supply throughout the world from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. Examines all forms of agriculture and acquaculture and the economic, technological and environmental factors affecting them. An indispensable reference for agriculturalists, economists, policy-makers, development and environment professionals worldwide.A detailed assessment of the long-term outlook for the world's food supplies, nutrition and agriculture from the world's foremost agricultural research institute. It examines outcomes from 2015 to 2030, covering supply and demand for all the major agricultural commodities and sectors, including fisheries and forestry. From this analysis, it examines the implications for trade, for nutrition and for undernourishment, and the impact of future production on the environment and resource base, and how technology can contribute to more sustainable development. One main finding is that, without a massive effort to improve development and relieve food security problems, there is little chance of meeting the target of halving the number of undernourished people by 2015. Agriculture is crucial to development, especially where it employs a majority of the population, and additional resources will have to be mobilized.},

abstract = {Several studies have shown that global crop production needs to double by 2050 to meet the projected demands from rising population, diet shifts, and increasing biofuels consumption. Boosting crop yields to meet these rising demands, rather than clearing more land for agriculture has been highlighted as a preferred solution to meet this goal. However, we first need to understand how crop yields are changing globally, and whether we are on track to double production by 2050. Using ∼2.5 million agricultural statistics, collected for ∼13,500 political units across the world, we track four key global crops-maize, rice, wheat, and soybean-that currently produce nearly two-thirds of global agricultural calories. We find that yields in these top four crops are increasing at 1.6{\%}, 1.0{\%}, 0.9{\%}, and 1.3{\%} per year, non-compounding rates, respectively, which is less than the 2.4{\%} per year rate required to double global production by 2050. At these rates global production in these crops would increase by ∼67{\%}, ∼42{\%}, ∼38{\%}, and ∼55{\%}, respectively, which is far below what is needed to meet projected demands in 2050. We present detailed maps to identify where rates must be increased to boost crop production and meet rising demands.},
